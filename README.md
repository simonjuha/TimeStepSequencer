# TimeStepSequencer
This is a sequencer made for controlling modular systems. It has 8 knobs controlling the time/length of each step and 8 knobs controlling the CV output for each step, generating interesting rhythmic patterns. The sequencer has a random mode, start/stop, two time-multipliers and a slide switch.
