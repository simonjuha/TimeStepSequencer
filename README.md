# TimeStepSequencer
This is a sequencer made for controlling modular systems. It has 8 knobs controlling the time/length of each step and 8 knobs controlling the CV output for each step, generating interesting rhythmic patterns. The sequencer has a random mode, start/stop, two time-multipliers and a slide switch.

See pictures and more [here](https://www.simonjuhl.net/timestep-sequencer)

I used an dual op-amp for to boost the CV output and to buff the trigger, but are not neccesary. look at the [.diy file](https://github.com/simonjuha/TimeStepSequencer/blob/master/timestep.diy) for stripboard-layout. You will have to open the file with [DIYLC](http://diy-fever.com/software/diylc/). Feel free to contact me if you have any questions: contact@simonjuhl.net :)
